# Natural-Language-Preprocessing-with-Machine-Learning

In Model Source Code/Model comparison.ipynb, the preprocessing and 4 different algorithms (Gradient Boost Machine, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) have been used to do comparison. The algortihm that show the best results will be store in PKL file for system. 

In Model Source Code/Model.ipynb, the function that will used in system will be simulated in this notebook. We used a set of sentences to test with the same preprocessing that have been done in Model comparison.ipynb and import the model export earlier to do testing.

In System/App/main.py

The function that simulated in Model.ipynb will be convert into websites which create with python. An user interface will be create for user to use the function.
